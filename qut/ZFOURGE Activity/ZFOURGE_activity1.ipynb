Given this is a research paper, you will likely come across many new words you're not familiar with â€“ don't let that frighten you! Digest what you can, and you'll be surprised how much you will pick up throughout the course of this project."

    "The ZFOURGE data is available from a number of places, including the [Virtual Observatory](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/ApJ/830/51). However, I recommend you acquire direct from the source - our [survey website](https://mjcowley.github.io/zfourge/). For now, select the CDFS catalogue (not the images). The catalogue data is provided in a tarball, which has been comrpessed. Most popular compression suites will be able to extract this file for you (e.g. [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html))"
