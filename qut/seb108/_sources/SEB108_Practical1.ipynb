This method simplifies the process of combining text and variables/data in output.\n",

    "What is this `ddof` in NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting `ddof=0` (the default) instructs NumPy to divide by `N`, which is suitable for calculating the population variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "- Setting `ddof=1` modifies the calculation to divide by `N-1`, making it suitable for sample variance and standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction is crucial in statistics, ensuring that the sample standard deviation accurately reflects the variability of the data. For our purposes, we're working with a sample of exam scores, so we set `ddof=1` to calculate the standard deviation correctly. We will invesigate statistics further in a later practical.\n"

    "Histogram\n",
    "- The top plot is a **Histogram** that displays the frequency distribution of your exam scores.\n",

    "- This means most scores are within 28.3 points above or below the average, giving you a sense of how spread out the scores are.\n",

    "What This Means for the Students\n",
    "- If their score is close to the average (62), they're in the most common score range for this exam.\n",
    "- If their score is far from the mean, the standard deviation helps them understand how their score compares with the rest of the class.\n",
    "- Remember, this distribution is a snapshot of this particular exam performance and each exam can have a different pattern.\n",
